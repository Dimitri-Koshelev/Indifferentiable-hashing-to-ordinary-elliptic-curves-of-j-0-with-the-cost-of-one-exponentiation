# Indifferentiable-hashing-to-ordinary-elliptic-curves-of-j-0-with-the-cost-of-one-exponentiation
Recently, my article https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10623-022-01012-8 was published in the quite prestigious cryptographic journal "Designs, Codes and Cryptography". This article provides a new hash function (indifferentiable from a random oracle) to the prime subgroup G1 of pairing-friendly elliptic curves BLS12-381 and BLS12-377 (Barreto-Lynn-Scott). These curves and such hash functions are actively used in blockchains, namely in the BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. My hash function is much faster than previous state-of-the-art ones, including the Wahby-Boneh indirect map. For instance, BLS12-377 is defined over a highly 2-adic finite field, hence the indifferentiable Wahby-Boneh hash function requires to apply twice the slow Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for extracting two square roots in the basic field. In comparison, the new hash function extracts only one cubic root, which can be expressed via one exponentiation in the finite field. I have already checked the correctness of my results in the computer algebra system Magma. The project is dedicated to implementing the new hash function in Sage.
